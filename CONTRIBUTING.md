# Process for submitting work to this project

* On Trello, pairs should assign themselves to a card in 'To do' and move it across to 'In progress'
* Make a branch and work on that branch
* When the feature is complete and the tests are passing, make a PR and move the ticket to QA
* Pairs must get 2 approvals before they merge the code - a dev can give one squirrel
  * The expectation is you give an approval if you understand how the code works and think it's of good quality
  * Try to use a PR as a knowledge-sharing ground
    - Write an informative description of what the PR changes, link it to a ticket for more information.
    - Discuss bits of code on the PR before approving.
* Once code is merged into master, ensure it is deployed correctly to heroku
* Move the ticket into 'Done' only once it is successfully in production
